              The Olist Store Analysis project aims to analyze customer purchasing patterns and payment statistics on an E-commerce platform, Olist. This project covers several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as weekday vs weekend sales, payment statistics, delivery time, and customer behavior. The analysis is based on nine CSV files, which are cleaned and manipulated to extract valuable insights.

# KPI's : 
• WEEKDAYS AND WEEKEND PAYMENT STATISTICS
• PAYMENT TYPE WITH REVIEW SCORE 5
• AVERAGE NUMBERS OF DELIVERY DAYS TAKEN FOR PET SHOP
• AVERAGE PRICE AND PAYMENT VALUE OF SAO PAULO CITY
• AVERAGE SHIPPING DAYS VS REVIEW SCORES

# Tools used :
- MySQL
- Power BI
- Tableau
- Excel

# Key Insights after project completion :
                                    According to the data, olist e-commerce has about 99,440 orders. With about 89,940 orders being delivered, the company has a 90% delivery success rate. Their average product rating is 4.09 stars, with product categories going as high as 4.67 stars and as low as 2.5 stars. 1 star reviews are on third place in the review score distribution ranking which likely indicates that there could be problems with product quality in some product categories. Delivery performance could also influence review scores and success rate could certainly be improved. Insights from this analysis can help in making business decisions, such as focusing on products that customers are interested in, improving product and service quality, and optimizing marketing in provinces with high total sales. In addition, this analysis also provides an overview of customer consumption trends and patterns that can be used to direct further business strategies.

# Conclusion : 
            The Olist Store Analysis project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and payment statistics. The analysis of these KPIs helps Olist in identifying areas of improvement and creating targeted marketing campaigns. As a data analyst, I have used Excel and Power BI to clean and manipulate the dataset and create meaningful visualizations. This project serves as a great example of how data analysis can help businesses make informed decisions.
